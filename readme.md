Set up your Django Application: First of all, make sure your Django application is ready. 
This means all your models, views, urls, and templates are properly set up. 
Test it locally on your development machine to ensure everything is working as expected.  
Transfer the Django Project to Raspberry Pi: Once your Django application is ready, you'll need to transfer it to your Raspberry Pi. 
You can use a tool like scp (secure copy) if you're on a Unix-based system, or a program like FileZilla. Alternatively, you could use a Git repository and clone it directly onto the Raspberry Pi.  
Install Necessary Software on Raspberry Pi: Make sure your Raspberry Pi is updated and install Python 3, pip, Django, and any other dependencies you need for your Django application. 
You can use the requirements.txt file to install all the Python dependencies.  
Set Up the Database on Raspberry Pi: Run migrations to set up the database Django will use. 
You can use the command python3 manage.py migrate to do this.  Run the Django Server on Raspberry Pi: You can start the Django development server using python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000. This will allow you to access the server from any device on the same network as the Raspberry Pi.  Access the Application from your iOS Device: Make sure your iOS device is connected to the same network as your Raspberry Pi. Open a web browser on your iOS device and enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi followed by :8000. You should now be able to access your Django application.  Integrate Sensors with Raspberry Pi: If your project involves using sensors, like for reading soil data, you'll need to write Python scripts that read from these sensors and feed this data into your Django application.  Set up a Regular Update Process: If you need the sensor data to be read at regular intervals (like every hour), you can use a task scheduler like cron to automatically run your Python scripts at the intervals you specify.
